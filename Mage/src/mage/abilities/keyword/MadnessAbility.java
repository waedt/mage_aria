/**
 * 702.33. Madness
 *
 * 702.33a. Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities.
 *
 * The first is a static ability that functions while the card with madness is in a player's hand.
 * The second is a triggered ability that functions when the first ability is applied.
 *
 * "Madness [cost]" means "If a player would discard this card, that player discards it, but may exile it instead of putting it into his or her graveyard" and
 * "When this card is exiled this way, its owner may cast it by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost.
 * If that player doesn't, he or she puts this card into his or her graveyard.
 *
 * 702.33b. Casting a spell using its madness ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e-g.
